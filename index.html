                    <p>This course focuses on the thesis research plan, addressing common challenges students face during the writing process. Unlike thesis workshops that concentrate on content, this course emphasizes writing in alignment with Business English requirements. Key areas covered include thesis assessment criteria, overall structure (chapter organization, introductions, transitions, summaries), company description, problem/opportunity analysis, research objectives, and main questions. It also covers summaries and connections of theories, justification, limitations, research methods, validity, reliability, ethics, and visual presentation. Additionally, the course guides on writing summaries, conclusions, sub-questions, executive summaries, and proper APA referencing to avoid plagiarism.</p>
