                        impact of business decisions. The module is divided into two parts.

                        The first part covers the basics of accounting, including transaction analysis, the adjusting
                        process, and the preparation of key financial statements like the Income Statement and Balance
                        Sheet. Students explore the accounting system behind these statements, focusing on the
                        double-entry accounting system used globally.

                        The second part introduces managerial accounting, with emphasis on cost concepts essential for
                        planning and business decisions. This includes performing cost-volume-profit analyses and
                        preparing operating and financial budgets.

                        While this module does not train students to become accountants, it equips them with fundamental
                        skills for interpreting financial information and understanding business operations from a
                        financial perspective.</p>

                    <p>​Mathematics is one of those subjects that most students fear. There is no need to be fearful of
                        mathematics, it is already around you and is affecting your daily life. The algorithms of the
                        apps you use on your phone are based on mathematics. The floor of the building, car or plane
                        that you are using right now, all wouldn't exist without mathematics. And, also good to know is
                        that everybody can learn mathematics, as long as they try. To use the words of Leon Brown, “You
                        are your worst enemy. It is your negative thoughts that hold you back, nothing else.”

                        To succeed in International Business, it is important that you take on challenges. Also, to
                        succeed in International Business, you need some basic understanding of mathematics and
                        statistics. This is what Introduction to Quantitative Methods (IQM) attempts to achieve; to
                        bring your understanding of business maths and stats to the level required in the International
                        Business field. During IQM, you will gain the skills and knowledge that you need in order to
                        follow other courses of the International Business program, such as finance, investment
                        analysis, research, and marketing. The instruction of business mathematics and business
                        statistics will involve many applied examples of situations where you can outsmart the
                        competition, and the customer, by making use of your newly acquired calculation skills. </p>

                    <p>​In Principles of Economics, students get a good understanding of the economic way of thinking by
                        studying the fundamentals of microeconomics. They will comprehend the market outcome of free
                        trade in different market types by studying marginal decision making of individuals and firms.
                        Finally, the module also discusses the market outcomes when markets fail.

                        Students obtain a grade by taking part in a written online exam (70%) that tests whether they
                        understand basic microeconomic concepts, theories and models. Also, students carry out a group
                        assignment (30%) that tests whether they can apply the concepts, theories and models.</p>

                        content will differ per group, but should include (a selection of) various business-related
                        articles. Students are free to choose the theme for the magazine, but all articles must have a
                        clear business angle.

                        You will write four articles, but not every article written will end up in the magazine. The

                        towards your end grade for the course as it is part of the individual portfolio. On completion
                        of the magazine, each group presents the final product to the class.

                        The individual portfolio will include the four business-related articles written during this
                        block, even if they are not included in the magazine. Students can choose four articles types

                        For the research assignment you need to apply the knowledge gained from the Business Research 1
                        and 2 modules and you will learn how to set-up and conduct primary research (Business Research
                        3). The business development assignment builds upon the knowledge and skill you have gained from
                        all the international business modules taught in years 1 and 2 of the IB programme. As such this
                        project aims to let you experience how all elements of international business integrate in the
                        setting of international business scaling of an SME company.

                        During block 3 teaching materials, by means of video recorded lectures, literature and
                        assignment related tasks, are made available to acquaint you with conducting primary research

                        coach) will support you in completing the assignments, but (s)he will not formally teach any
                        literature. At the beginning of the semester, a list of relevant, required literature from

                        deepening knowledge in Marketing and Sales, as well as actual developments in these fields.

                        This module aims to provide students a dual focus between Digital Marketing and Business to
                        Business (B2B) Sales. For Digital Marketing, you are introduced to the practice of Customer
                        Experience Management (CEM), where you will learn to use the tools (such as Google Analytics)
                        that help decode the company’s digital landscape. This will in turn provide the data needed to
                        analyse and shape customer experience.

                        The Sales part of the module will look at 3 distinct, yet fully interdependent, aspects of B2B
                        sales. First, we will discuss the roles of Digital marketing, Sales, and Customer Service, and
                        how they interact with each other. The Consultative Sales Cycle will be central in this part of
                        the course. You will learn how Digital Marketing instruments and after-sales (customer service)
                        tactics create new continuous growth opportunities. Furthermore, you will study from the
                        corporate buyers’ (or purchasing, or procurement) perspectives, and reflect on the increasing
                        importance of their role in recent years.

                        A key component of this module is on the integration of these two elements, which will lead to
                        the creation of cohesive strategies that combine the best of both Digital Marketing and Sales.

                        In this module, you will get to know the theory behind leadership skills and you will put them
                        into practice in various situations.

                        It has become widely recognized that both soft skills and hard skills are required in today's
                        highly competitive job market. Soft skills are personal qualities such as communication,
                        conflict resolution and creative problem solving. Hard skills refer to the knowledge acquired in
                        order to complete a task, while soft skills have to do with how well the job is performed and
                        how effectively a person is able to function under pressure – both in your studies and at work.

                        In the previous Leadership Development modules, you learned more about yourself through the
                        themes ''Who am I?,'' ''Team development'' and “Your own personal development.” In this module
                        you take a deeper dive into several business fields and you will prepare for a start in the job

                    <p>An Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system can be thought of as a company-wide information

                        enterprise-wide software packages that automate core corporate activities - business processes -
                        such as manufacturing, supply and distribution, financials and human resources.

                        ERP systems link all areas of a business with external suppliers and customers into a tightly
                        integrated system with shared data and visibility. ERP systems have a major impact on the
                        processes in an organisation. Many companies are implementing ERP systems, and (future)
                        employees must become familiar with new process-oriented working methods. Higher-educated staff
                        must have an overview of various complex automated processes in their area of competence, for
                        example in the areas of finance or logistics.

                    <p>Being creative helps you become a better problem solver in all areas of your life and work.
                        Creativity helps you see things differently and better deal with uncertainty. With the ability
                        to think creatively and outside the box, you will be more likely to come up with unique and
                        innovative solutions to obstacles you encounter. This eagerness to solve problems can lead to
                        new ways to accomplish tasks and innovative thinking.

                        Moving away from analytical thinking, this course aims to provide you with different strategies,
                        tools and ideas to inspire your creativity and problem-solving skills. Through a variety of
                        interactive teaching methods based on experiential learning, you will embark on a journey of
                        creative discovery. Creativity is a function of knowledge (theories and models), curiosity,
                        imagination, and evaluation. The greater your knowledge base and level of curiosity, the more
                        ideas, patterns, and combinations you can achieve, which then correlates to creating new and
                        innovative products and services.

                        Over a period of eights weeks you will be introduced to different creativity techniques by
                        reading articles, watching video's and/or Ted Talks and completing practical, creative
                        exercises. You will also get the opportunity to engage with people from the corporate world to
                        discuss creativity as a much sought after 21st century skill.

                        Each lesson week has a different theme all leading up to the final week during which you will be
                        required to do a presentation.

                        environment as well as in their personal lives.

                        The way to come to a decision is

                        1. To gather all relevant information and analyse it

                        2. Make a rational decision, i.e. acknowledge the fact that your thinking is biased.

                        This course provides insights in how people manage information. It also provides tools to
                        prevent logical pitfalls and to visualise reasoning fundamental to correct decision making.

                        Aspects of Philosphy (e.g.logic) and Psychology (e.g. biases) are part of the program.

                        In the Anglo-Saxon world Critical Thinking is increasingly becoming an entrance requirement or

                    <p>"Think Global. Act Local." It's easily said but difficult to apply. The module Managing in a
                        Global Economy introduces you to the latest theoretical knowledge and practical application for
                        doing business worldwide. In this module, you will find out that there is no one 'global
                        strategy' and gain an in-depth understanding of why strategic action differs among firms and
                        places and how firms compete in foreign markets.

                        The module focuses on three main themes:

                        i) the global context,

                        ii) SMEs (small and medium enterprises) and MNEs (multinational enterprises) and

                        iii) international strategic partnerships.

                        There are textbook chapters, an academic article, and cases for each theme. Students will
                        analyse cases and form opinions about firms' international strategies. Furthermore, writing
                        blogs will form an integral part of aligning the thematic theories to the practicalities of
                        doing business in a (semi)global context. At all times, debate and discussion in the class will
                        empower students to take on the challenges ahead in international business confidently.</p>

                    <p>Successful brand positioning strategies imply that the marketer is able to get under the skin of
                        his target audiences, to get an in-depth understanding of their key motivations, and to be able
                        to act upon them. To do this successfully, a thorough understanding of consumer behavior is an
                        absolute necessity.

                        During this semester module you will design branding strategies by combining theories about
                        branding with core concepts of consumer behaviour, with theoretical insights on topics such as:

                        Consumer psychology and segmentation: Benefits, perceptions, and attitudes

                        Brand imagery and brand psychology: Brand values, brand archetypes and brand personality

                        Cultural influences on consumer behaviour

                        Consumer decision making and the customer journey

                        Brand identity: the four laws of branding

                        Brand positioning and storytelling

                        Brand book

                        You learn how to apply this knowledge to understand values and motivations of your target
                        audience, and connect these with the added value (in terms of values and benefits) offered by
                        brands / organizations. In a real-life project, you use brand identity and brand image theory to
                        design the brand positioning strategy (marketing strategy) for a corporate or individual brand.

                        more appropriate now than ever in this digital and instant communications era. Globalisation has
                        impacted businesses in a such a phenomenal way that it is virtually impossible to escape from it
                        as they have come to realise that it is imperative to have a global presence. Going across
                        borders means dealing with different cultures, traditions, laws, and regulations. The ability to

                        capture consumers and markets.

                        This course reviews the principles of marketing communications, its theoretical frameworks and
                        applications in a global perspective. The various forms of promotional tools (advertising,
                        publicity, PR, social media and so forth) will be discussed and analysed to determine their
                        usage in different cultural contexts and in what ways businesses can use the tools responsibly
                        (CSR) and ethically in order to make sound communications decisions. Cases from a wide variety
                        of backgrounds will be analysed to provide an understanding of the dilemmas (for example,
                        standardisation vs. adaptation of a communications campaign) businesses frequently face and how
                        they may be overcome. The course also addresses digital formats of communications (e.g. social
                        media, blogs, vlogs) as new forms of communications within the broader media landscape. </p>

                        (services) orientation. The module offers an in-depth treatment of contemporary trust-based

                        expanding customer relationships and sales management. The transaction-based orientation is
                        confronted with the relationship-based orientation by offering insights into relationship

                    <p>This module is the final module of the Professional Development learning track where you learn
                        and use tools to enlarge your personal leadership skills and knowledge. These will guide you on
                        your career path after graduation.

                        You will reflect on your personal leadership and your learning curve. You will work closely with
                        classmates, practising your personal leadership skills. You will receive feedback from
                        classmates and others. You will work on a personal development plan in which you determine what
                        is needed for your future career path.

                        You will learn tools, ideas and mindsets that will help you to design your future. You will use
                        tools and exercises to explore questions such as: How do I find a job that I like? How can I
                        make a difference in the world? You will work in groups to support each other through this
                        process of exploration.</p>

                        Research exercises use the “Global Entrepreneurship Monitor” with which economic and cultural
                        analyses are done. Explanations of how to select variables and which types of basic statistical
                        analyses can be applied, are part of the lectures. This module is designed to provide the
                        analytical skills necessary to succeed in a business environment. These skills include working
                        with theory, selecting and applying appropriate research designs and methods, and interpreting
                        analysis results for strategic management information. </p>
